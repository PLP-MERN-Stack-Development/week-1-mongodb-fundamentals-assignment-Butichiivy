## Assignment Overview

You will:
1. Set up a MongoDB database
2. Perform basic CRUD operations
3. Write advanced queries with filtering, projection, and sorting
4. Create aggregation pipelines for data analysis
5. Implement indexing for performance optimization

## Getting Started

1. Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment invitation
2. Clone your personal repository that was created by GitHub Classroom

- MongoDB setup
- Creating a database and collection
- Performing CRUD operations
- Writing advanced queries
- Using aggregation pipelines
- Creating indexes and analyzing query performance

---

## üß™ Technologies Used

- MongoDB Community Edition
- MongoDB Shell (`mongosh`)
- MongoDB Compass

|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `insert_books.js` | Inserts 10 book documents into the `books` collection        |
| `queries.js`      | Contains all MongoDB queries for Tasks 2‚Äì5                   |
| `screenshot.png`  | Screenshot of MongoDB Compass showing inserted documents     |
| `README.md`       | Instructions for running and testing the project             |

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run the Project

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Start MongoDB

Make sure MongoDB is installed and running. Then open a terminal:

```bash
mongosh



Paste the content of insert_books.js into the shell to insert book documents.

‚úÖ Step 2: Run Queries
Copy and paste the queries from queries.js into the same shell. The queries include:

Task 2: CRUD operations (find, update, delete)

Task 3: Advanced queries (filters, projections, sorting, pagination)

Task 4: Aggregation pipelines (grouping and analysis)

Task 5: Index creation and performance analysis using .explain()

‚úÖ Submission Checklist
 Inserted 10 books using insert_books.js

 All required queries written in queries.js

 Screenshot of MongoDB Compass added as screenshot.png

 README with instructions included

 Everything committed and pushed to GitHub

üí° Notes
You can use mongosh to run and test queries

Use MongoDB Compass to view data and take a screenshot

Ensure your local MongoDB server is running before inserting or querying
